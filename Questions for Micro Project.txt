1. How many instructions are to be fetched to the instruction buffer every cycle (superscalar or not)?
Instruction memory, L3, l2 say7een, l1 instruction cache.
2. What is the replacement policy for the instruction buffer (replace every issued instruction/wait till the buffer is empty/etc..) ?
3. Is there a difference between instruction cache and instruction memory?


4. [RESOLVED, Lec 12] What are ROB entries? (as specified in the project description, page 2)
5. Should load instructions take one extra cycle for computing address (during issue/during execute)?
6. How to specify starting address for instruction?
7. [RESOLVED: NO] Necessary to keep flags for branching, etc. ? 
8. Issue-Execute dilemma (when to start executing and decrementing cycles)
